                <h1>About Me:</h1>
                <p>I am the creator and owner of this website. My name is Muhammad Saleh Mobeen Qureshi. I created this
                    website
                    to share my skills with other people. Here, you can find the games I have developed, which you can
                    download
                    and enjoy.</p>

                <h1>My Skills:</h1>
                <p>In past few years I have developed many skills that help me create this website and exiting games.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Programming:</strong> I started programing with Scratch which is a visual Programming
                        language
                        that taught me the basics of programming and logic. Then I learnt HTML, CSS and Javascript which
                        helped
                        me to understand how textual programming works. </li>
                    <br><br>
                    <li><strong>Speed Cubing:</strong> Solving Rubik's cube quickly, with an average solve time of 25
                        seconds,
                        has honed my problem-solving abilities and enabled me to develop effective solutions.</li>
                    <br><br>
                    <li><strong>Pen Spinning:</strong> Penspinning isn't just fun,it's taught me coordination and finger
                        control, making me quicker at typing and writing code fast.</li>
                    <br><br>

            </div>
